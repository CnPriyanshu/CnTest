Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## GENERAL EXPECTATIONS

1. Show git knowledge by branching and merging, appropriate commit messages, etc.
2. Leave no unused vars or other comments/console logs, etc.
3. Explain your thought process for any decisions you make.
4. Include any additional comments or feedback you would like to provide.

## PART 1

1. Fix any errors that are occurring within the project. This includes any images that are not displayed correctly, any components not displaying, any errors running the project, etc.
2. Get the data properly hooked up. You will find a db.json file in the root of the project. You will need to hook up the data to the page.
3.
4. Explain what components would be needed for the design. What are some considerations we should make/what are some potential issues we might run into? Think Mobile First. Add these to the notes section below.

### PART 1 Notes

I found that initially the code was not working due to some issues with the response from the fetch method, but I have resolved this. Additionally, the intro image on the about page was not displaying at full width, which has now been fixed.

The design for the about page has been created in the about.js file. I also created a new file, Event.js, to display events and reuse the components.

## PART 2

1. For part 2, create this section on the about page. Both mobile and desktop comps have been provided. We need pixel perfect replication of the design.

### PART 2 Notes

The design for the about page has been created, but I couldn't find the same image in the db.json file, so I used a different image instead. Regarding pixel perfection, I didn't have the exact font size, color, or spacing details from the provided image, so I adjusted these elements to make it look as good as possible.
